This is a backup of WhatsApp app for Windows (version 2.2543.1.0), back when it still a UWP app. Made using [Appx-Backup](https://github.com/mjmeans/Appx-Backup) script.

You'll need to install the .cer file before installing the .appx. Follow the guide [here](https://wsldl-pg.github.io/ArchW-docs/Install-Certificate/)

This really saved me when the app suddenly updates somehow, knowing how much I hate the WebView2 version. Thought y'all might need it.
